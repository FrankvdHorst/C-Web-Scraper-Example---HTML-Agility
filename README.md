# C# Web Scraper Example - HTML-Agility
Since I was searching for some examples with C# in the past myself on how to web scrape data from websites I decided to publish this very simple C# HTML Agility example. Hope it's usefull!

This script is grabbing stock advise data from https://www.beleggen.nl/adviezen/default.aspx and displays the result in a console window.

Please note that the data which it's grabbing might be copyrighted. This is just to show you how you can easily grab data from any website using HTML-Agility Pack in C#.
